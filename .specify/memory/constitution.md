# Human Connectome Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Best Practice

Code should leverage software development best practice. This means effectively leveraging patterns, separation of concerns, pure functions where possible, and unit testing.

### V. Modular and Extensible Architecture

The system will be designed in a modular way to allow for future extensions and integrations. This promotes flexibility and long-term viability.

## Development Workflow

All development must follow a structured workflow:

1.  **Specification**: A clear specification must be written and approved before any implementation begins.
2.  **Implementation**: Code must be written to the specification.
3.  **Testing**: All code must be accompanied by tests.
4.  **Review**: All code must be peer-reviewed.
5.  **Deployment**: Code is deployed after passing all checks.

## Governance

This Constitution is the supreme governing document of the Human Connectome project. It can only be amended by a majority vote of the project's core contributors.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-01 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-01
